Playwright Test Runner Infrastructure with ArgoCD & Report Viewer
This repository sets up an automated test execution environment using Playwright and Kubernetes, integrated with ArgoCD for GitOps-style deployment. The environment includes persistent storage for test reports and an NGINX-based report viewer accessible via NodePort.

⚙️ Key Components
✅ ArgoCD: Manages the Kubernetes manifests and ensures continuous sync and deployment based on Git changes.
✅ Test Jobs:
- job-test.yaml: Runs Playwright tests using a configurable entrypoint script.
- job-merge.yaml: Merges multiple shard reports into a unified directory.
✅ Persistent Volume: pvc.yaml and pv.yaml define the shared volume where test results are written.
✅ NGINX Report Viewer: nginx-report-viewer.yaml deploys NGINX and exposes the reports.
🚀 Usage
1. 🔧 Build & Push Image
 make build make push 
2. 🧬 Patch the Jobs with Unique RUN_ID
 cd patch_jobs ./launch-local-run.sh 
This script generates a unique RUN_ID, injects it into the job manifests, applies local kustomize overlays, and commits + pushes to Git.
3. 🌐 View Reports
Option 1: Port Forward (Local Testing)
 kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-report-viewer 8080:80 -n playwright Visit: http://localhost:8080 
Option 2: NodePort (Docker Desktop, Minikube)
http://<your-node-ip>:30080
🧪 Notes
 - All reports are stored in /results/<RUN_ID>/<SHARD_INDEX>/. - NGINX autoindexes folders and allows browser navigation. - Playwright tests use sharding via environment variables. 
📦 Optional Enhancements
 - Convert nginx-report-viewer to a Deployment for resiliency. - Archive merged reports or upload to S3. - Add Grafana dashboards to visualize test executions. 
🧩 Requirements
 - Kubernetes cluster (Docker Desktop tested) - ArgoCD - Docker - Make
